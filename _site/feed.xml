        <title>NetworkManager not able to Lease an IP from a router — How to Manually Request an IP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;NetworkManager may throw the error &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Error: Connection activation failed: (5) IP configuration could not be reserved (no available address, timeout, etc.).&lt;/code&gt;  This means for some reason the wifi card is able to connect to the AP, but it is unable to reserve a dynamic IP with DHCP. In this guide I will explain a potential solution to the problem (particularly if it is your wifi card that is the problem and not the access point) which is to request an IP manually using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dhclient&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-one&quot;&gt;Step One&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this step, we will have NetworkManager manually connect to the AP as root, I’ve found this step to just ensure that the system is in the right state for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dhcleint&lt;/code&gt; to manually request an IP. This can be done by opening up a terminal, and running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;sudo nmcli d wifi Connect $wifi_access_point_SSID password $wifi_access_point_password&lt;br /&gt;
In which &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$wifi_access_point_SSID&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the network you are trying to connect to, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$wifi_access_point_password&lt;/code&gt; is the password to the network you are trying to connect to. After that command is executed, your wifi card should try to connect to the AP, after which it will throw the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Error: Connection activation failed: (5) IP configuration could not be reserved (no available address, timeout, etc.).&lt;/code&gt; error. Once you have this error, you can proceed to step two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-two&quot;&gt;Step Two&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nmcli&lt;/code&gt; has thown the error above, we can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dhclient&lt;/code&gt; to manually ask for an IP. This is done though the command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;sudo dhclient -v&lt;br /&gt;
You should see &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dhclient&lt;/code&gt; request an IP, and after a few minutes, it should return &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bound: renewal in $number seconds.&lt;/code&gt;, in which $number is how many seconds the lease is, which also means your wifi card was successfuly granted an IP lease!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
